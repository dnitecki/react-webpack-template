## Introduction

> This lightweight **React** template comes configured with Webpack 5 to support Hot Module Reloading, TS and SASS. The template is developed to be as customaziable and unopinionaded as possible. My goal with this CLI is to create a React template that helps developers of all skill levels have a great starting point for their next React project while avoiding common Create-react-app related issues like out of the box vulnerablities, depricated dependencies, and hard to customize configurations.

## Installation

To install run the following command:

```bash
npm install @dnitecki/react-webpack-template
```

To create a React template run the following command:

```bash
create-react-template
```

or

```bash
create-react-template your-react-app-name
```
